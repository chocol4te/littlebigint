# smolbigint

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chocol4te/smolbigint.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chocol4te/smolbigint)

Zero allocation big integer library for `no_std` Rust.

Honestly, you're probably much better off using [`num-bigint`](https://github.com/rust-num/num-bigint). Only use this library if you *absolutely* need to be zero allocation because it just doesn't have the same breadth of functionality nor the extensive testing of `num-bigint`.

Quite the pep talk, I know.
